# exit

This crate exposes a type, `Exit`, which allows using `?` in `main` while also specifying custom exit status codes. See the examples for details. 

The goal of this crate was to provide a proof of concept and sample implementation for the ideas discussed in [this blog post](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/custom-exit-status-codes-rust/).
